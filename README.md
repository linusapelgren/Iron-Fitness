## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

4. In the 'Settings' tab and from here I located the section 'Config Vars' and clicked 'Reveal Config Vars'
5. Ensure that within the settings.py file the DEBUG has been set to False
6. From here you can add your environment variables for your Database, Secret Key, CollecStatic, Cloudinary Database, Stripe Public Key, Stripe Private Key and Webhook Secret. 
7. After this has been done navigate to the 'Deploy' tab and under 'Deployment Method' click on 'GitHub'.
